We have a few adjustments to make to the application.



1. When a movie is added to the "Pass" list the movie is added to the pass list but the system seems to pull the
exact same movie up as the next recommendation.  It looks like the pass list is not excluding movies stored in the
pass list from the recommendations.



2.  Inside the filter options section the second option is to exclude movies with the same actor as last watched.
This is the opposite of what I wanted it to be.  It should be:  Movies with actors from the last movie watched.  The
 goal of this selection is that the recommendation should include at least 1 of the actors that was also in the
previously watched movie.



I would also like to show a small movie poster and title somewhere on the screen of the last watched movie.  Then if
 this is selected I want the recommendation to show the actor that is linked to the previous movie.



Only show this option if the user has a previously watched movie.  Hide the selection until the user has a
previously watched movie.



This option should be an exclusive option with the "Filter by Actor" selection.  I would like both of these to be
grouped together visually.  If the checkbox is checked then the ability to filter by a single actor is hidden and
any selection populated previously into that field is ignored.



3.  The same logic and changes for the 2nd item should also apply to the 3rd filter "Exclude Movies from Same
Director as Last Watched.  This should be "Movies with the same director as the last movie watched".



4.  The first selection of "Exclude Watched Movies" does not seem to be filtering movies that have been watched
already.  Lets make sure that the application is filtering movies that have been previously watched by the user.



5.  Can we make the top menu of recommendations, passed movies, and Logout into a collapsible menu so that the top
logo has more room on smaller mobile screens?
